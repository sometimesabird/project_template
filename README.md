# A New Project Template
See the README files in the directories for details.

# Makefile
Makefile uses pandoc to convert all markdown files in the project directory into pdfs, using metadata and lua from config/. It also runs the makefile in reports/slides that applies config/header.tex to md files there to generate presentation pdfs.

# Dotfiles
- .Renviron: basically empty;
- .Rprofile: some setting up;
- .here: anchor for folders (here package for R).
